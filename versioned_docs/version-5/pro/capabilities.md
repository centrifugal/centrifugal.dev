At this point you know that Centrifugo allows configuring channel permissions on a per-namespace level. When creating a new real-time feature it's recommended to create a new namespace for it and configure permissions. To achieve a better channel permission control inside a namespace Centrifugo PRO provides possibility to set capabilities on individual connection basis, or individual channel subscription basis.

Let's start by looking at connection-wide capabilities first.

## Connection capabilities

Connection capabilities can be set:

* in connection JWT (in `caps` claim)
* in connect proxy result (`caps` field)

For example, here we are issuing permissions to subscribe on channel `news` and channel `user_42` to a client:

```json
{
    "caps": [
        {
            "channels": ["news", "user_42"],
            "allow": ["sub"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Known capabilities:

* `sub` - subscribe to a channel to receive publications from it
* `pub` - publish into a channel (your backend won't be able to process the publication in this case)
* `prs` - call presence and presence stats API, also consume join/leave events upon subscribing
* `hst` - call history API, also make Subscription positioned or recoverable upon subscribing

### Caps processing behavior

Centrifugo processes caps objects till it finds a match to a channel. At this point it applies permissions in the matched object and stops processing remaining caps. If no match found â€“ then `103 permission denied` returned to a client (of course if namespace does not have other permission-related options enabled). Let's consider example like this:

```json title="WRONG!"
{
    "caps": [
        {
            "channels": ["news"],
            "allow": ["pub"]
        },
        {
            "channels": ["news"],
            "allow": ["sub"]
        },
    ]
}
```

Here we have two entries for channel `news`, but when client subscribes on `news` only the first entry will be taken into considiration by Centrifugo â€“ so Subscription attempt will be rejected (since first cap object does not have `sub` capability). In real life you don't really want to have cap objects with identical channels â€“ but below we will introduce wildcard matching where understanding how caps processed becomes important.

Another example:

```json title="WRONG!"
{
    "caps": [
        {
            "channels": ["news", "user_42"],
            "allow": ["sub"]
        },
        {
            "channels": ["user_42"],
            "allow": ["pub", "hst", "prs"]
        },
    ]
}
```

One could expect that client will have `["sub", "pub", "hst", "prs"]` capabilities for a channel `user_42`. But it's not true since Centrifugo processes caps objects and channels inside caps object in order â€“ it finds a match to `user_42` in first caps object, it contains only `"sub"` capability, processing stops. So user can subscribe to a channel, but can not publish, can not call history and presence APIs even though those capabilities are mentioned in `caps` object. The correct way to give all caps to the channel `user_42` would be to split channels into different caps objects:

```json title="CORRECT"
{
    "caps": [
        {
            "channels": ["news"],
            "allow": ["sub"]
        },
        {
            "channels": ["user_42"],
            "allow": ["sub", "pub", "hst", "prs"]
        },
    ]
}
```

The processing behaves like this to avoid potential problems with possibly conflicting matches (mostly when using wildcard and regex matching â€“ see below) and still allow overriding capabilities for specific channels.

### Expiration considirations

* In JWT auth case â€“ capabilities in JWT will work till token expiration, that's why it's important to keep reasonably small token expiration times. We can recommend using sth like 5-10 mins as a good expiration value, but of course this is application specific.
* In connect proxy case â€“ capabilities will work until client connection close (disconnect) or connection refresh triggered (with refresh proxy you can provide an updated set of capabilities).

### Revoking connection caps

If at some point you need to revoke some capability from a client:

* Simplest way is to wait for a connection expiration, then upon refresh:
    * if using proxy â€“ provide new caps in refresh proxy result, Centrifugo will update caps and unsubscribe a client from channels it does not have permissions anymore (**only those obtained due to previous connection-wide capabilities**).
    * if JWT auth - provide new caps in connection token, Centrifugo will update caps and unsubscribe a client from channels it does not have permissions anymore (**only those obtained due to previous connection-wide capabilities**).
* In case of using connect proxy â€“ you can disconnect a user (or client) with a reconnect code. New capabilities will be asked upon reconnection.
* In case of using token auth â€“ revoke token (Centrifugo PRO feature) and disconnect user (or client) with reconnect code. Upon reconnection user will receive an error that token revoked and will try to load a new one.

### Example: wildcard match

It's possible to use wildcards in channel resource names. For example, let's give a permission to subscribe on all channels in `news` namespace.

```json
{
    "caps": [
        {
            "channels": ["news:*"],
            "match": "wildcard",
            "allow": ["sub"]
        }
    ]
}
```

:::note

Match type is used for all `channels` in caps object. If you need different matching behavior for different channels then split them on different caps objects.

:::

### Example: regex match

Or regex:

```json
{
    "caps": [
        {
            "channels": ["^posts_[\d]+$"],
            "match": "regex",
            "allow": ["sub"]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example: different types of match

Of course it's possible to combine different types of match inside one `caps` array:

```json
{
    "caps": [
        {
            "channels": ["^posts_[\d]+$"],
            "match": "regex",
            "allow": ["sub"]
        }
        {
            "channels": ["user_42"],
            "allow": ["sub"]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example: full access to all channels

Let's look how to allow all permissions to a client:

```json
{
    "caps": [
        {
            "channels": ["*"],
            "match": "wildcard",
            "allow": ["sub", "pub", "hst", "prs"]
        }
    ]
}
```

:::danger Full access warn

Should we mention that giving full access to a client is something to wisely consider? ðŸ¤”

## Subscription capabilities

Subscription capabilities can be set:

* in subscription JWT (in `allow` claim)
* in subscribe proxy result (`allow` field)

Subscription token already belongs to a channel (it has a `channel` claim). So users with a valid subscription token can subscribe to a channel. But it's possible to additionally grant channel permissions to a user for publishing and calling presence and history using `allow` claim:

```json
{
    "allow": ["pub", "hst", "prs"]
}
```

Putting `sub` permission to the Subscription token does not make much sense â€“ Centrifugo only expects valid token for a subscription permission check.

### Expiration considirations

* In JWT auth case â€“ capabilities in subscription JWT will work till token expiration, that's why it's important to keep reasonably small token expiration times. We can recommend using sth like 5-10 mins as a good expiration value, but of course this is application specific.
* In subscribe proxy case â€“ capabilities will work until client unsubscribe (or connection close).

### Revoking subscription permissions

If at some point you need to revoke some capability from a client:

* Simplest way is to wait for a subscription expiration, then upon refresh:
    * provide new caps in subscription token, Centrifugo will update channel caps.
* In case of using subscribe proxy â€“ you can unsubscribe a user (or client) with a resubscribe code. Or disconnect with reconnect code. New capabilities will be set up upon resubscription/reconnection.
* In case of using JWT auth â€“ revoke token (Centrifugo PRO feature) and unsubscribe/disconnect user (or client) with resubscribe/reconnect code. Upon resubscription/reconnection user will receive an error that token revoked and will try to load a new one.
