title: User and channel tracing

That's a unique thing. The tracing feature of Centrifugo PRO allows attaching to any channel to see all messages flying towards subscribers or attach to a specific user ID to see all user-related events in real-time.

It's possible to attach to trace streams using Centrifugo admin UI panel or simply from terminal using CURL and admin token. 

This can be super-useful for debugging issues, investigating application behavior, understanding that the application works as expected.

### Save to a file

It's possible to connect to the admin tracing endpoint with CURL using the admin session token. And then save tracing output to a file for later processing.

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/trace -H "Authorization: token <ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN>" -d '{"type": "user", "entity": "56"}' -o trace.txt
```

Currently, you should copy the admin auth token from browser developer tools, this may be improved in the future as PRO version evolves.
