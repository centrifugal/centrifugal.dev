PRO features can change with time. We reserve a right to move features from PRO to OSS version if there is a clear signal that this is required to do for the Centrifugo ecosystem.

## Sandbox mode

You can try out Centrifugo PRO for free. When you start Centrifugo PRO without license key then it's running in a sandbox mode. Sandbox mode limits the usage of Centrifigo PRO in several ways. For example:

* Centrifugo handles up to 50 concurrent connections
* up to 2 server nodes supported
* up to 20 API requests per second allowed

This mode should be enough for development and trying out PRO features, but must not be used in production environment as we can introduce additional limitations in the future.

:::caution

Centrifugo PRO is distributed under [commercial license](/license) which is different from OSS version. By downloading Centrifugo PRO you automatically accept license terms.
