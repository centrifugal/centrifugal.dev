It allows getting all active sessions of the user (by user ID) without turning on presence feature for channels at all. It\'s also possible to attach any JSON payload to a connection which will be then visible in the result of userconnections call. The important thing is that this additional meta information won\'t be exposed to a client-side (unlike connection info for example).","sidebar":"Pro"},"pro/user_status":{"id":"pro/user_status","title":"User status","description":"Centrifugo OSS provides a presence feature for channels.

In most cases, this is the most flexible approach since a client-side usually knows which channels it needs to consume at a concrete moment. But in some situations, all you need is to subscribe your connections to several channels on a server-side at the moment of connection establishment.
