This can be a no problem for some infrastructures but can be really disastrous for others. JWT allows to reduce this spike in load on session storage since it can have all required authentication information inside its payload.

Learn how your ingress behaves \u2013 for example Nginx ingress can reload its configuration on every change inside Kubernetes services map resulting into closing all active WebSocket connections.
