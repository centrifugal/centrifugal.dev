If you need to know that client disconnected and program your business logic around this fact then the reasonable approach could be periodically call your backend while client connection is active and update status somewhere on the backend (possibly using Redis for this). Then periodically do clealup logic for connections/users not updated for a configured interval. This is a robust solution where you can't occasionally miss disconnect events. You can also utilize Centrifugo ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"/docs/server/proxy#connect-proxy"},"connect proxy")," + ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"/docs/server/proxy#refresh-proxy"},"refresh proxy")," for getting notified about initial connection and get periodic refresh requests while connection is alive."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"The trade-off of the described workaround scenario is that you will notice disconnection only with some delay \u2013 this may be a acceptable in many cases though."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Having said that, processing disconnect events may be reasonable \u2013 as a best-effort solution while taking into account everything said above.
