In a normal PUB/SUB setup, all publications are propagated to all nodes in the Redis Cluster, reducing throughput as more Redis nodes are added. The utilization of Redis shards is usually unequal when using PUB/SUB in Redis Cluster as subscriptions land to one of the shards. With sharded PUB/SUB, the channel keyspace is divided into slots (similar to normal keys), and PUB/SUB operations are distributed across Redis Cluster nodes based on channel names."]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h4,{id:"custom-keyspace-partitioning",children:"Custom keyspace partitioning"}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["When using Centrifugo PRO ",(0,t.jsx)(n.a,{href:"/docs/pro/scalability#redis-cluster-sharded-pubsub",children:"with the sharded PUB/SUB feature"}),', several important considerations must be kept in mind.
