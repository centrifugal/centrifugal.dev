<p>Posted Date: December 23, 2023</p>
<p>This Agreement is established between Centrifugal Labs LTD and you, or the legal entity you represent or act on behalf of (referred to as &quot;You&quot;).</p>
<ol>
<li>OBJECT CODE END USER LICENSES, RESTRICTIONS AND THIRD PARTY OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1 Object Code End User License. Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 1.2 of this Agreement, Centrifugal Labs hereby grants to You, AT NO CHARGE and for so long as you are not in breach of any provision of this Agreement, a License to the free features and functions of the Centrifugal Labs Software.</p>
<p>1.2 Reservation of Rights; Restrictions. As between Centrifugal Labs and You, Centrifugal Labs and its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to the Centrifugal Labs Software, and any related documentation or other intellectual property rights, and except as expressly set forth in Sections 1.1 of this Agreement, no other license to the Centrifugal Labs Software is granted to You under this Agreement, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. You agree not to: (i) reverse engineer or decompile, decrypt, disassemble or otherwise reduce any Centrifugal Labs Software provided to You in Object Code, or any portion thereof, to Source Code, except and only to the extent any such restriction is prohibited by applicable law, or otherwise build a competitive product or service, build a product or service using similar ideas, features, functions or graphics, or create any compilations or derivative works thereof, (ii) except as expressly permitted in Section 1.1 above, transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense, loan or otherwise transfer or commercially exploit or make available, Centrifugal Labs Software Object Code, in whole or in part, to any third party; (iii) use Centrifugal Labs Software Object Code for providing time-sharing services, any software-as-a-service, service bureau services or as part of an application services provider or other service offering (collectively, “SaaS Offering”) where obtaining access to the Centrifugal Labs Software or the features and functions of the Centrifugal Labs Software is a primary reason or substantial motivation for users of the SaaS Offering to access and/or use the SaaS Offering (“Prohibited SaaS Offering”); (iv) circumvent the limitations on use of Centrifugal Labs Software provided to You in Object Code format that are imposed or preserved by any License Key, (v) alter or remove any Marks and Notices in the Centrifugal Labs Software, or (vi) violate any of Centrifugal Labs’ posted policies regarding its Marks and Notices.

<li>MISCELLANEOUS</li>
</ol>
<p>This Agreement completely and exclusively states the entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter herein, and it supersedes, and its terms govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter.

If any provision hereof is held unenforceable, this Agreement will continue without said provision and be interpreted to reflect the original intent of the parties. This Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with it, is governed exclusively by Cyprus law. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including its existence and validity, shall be resolved by the courts with jurisdiction in Cyprus. The parties hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and defenses either might otherwise have in any such action or proceeding in any of such courts based upon any alleged lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, forum non conveniens or any similar claim or defense.
