In general, integrating Centrifugo can be done in several steps even without third-party libraries – see our [integration guide](../getting-started/integration.md). But there are some community-driven projects that provide integration for more native experience or even some additional functionality on top of Centrifugo.

:::

* [laravel-centrifugo](https://github.com/denis660/laravel-centrifugo) integration with Laravel framework
* [laravel-centrifugo-broadcaster](https://github.com/opekunov/laravel-centrifugo-broadcaster) one more integration with Laravel framework to consider
* [CentrifugoBundle](https://github.com/fre5h/CentrifugoBundle) integration with Symfony framework
* [Django-instant](https://github.com/synw/django-instant) integration with Django framework
