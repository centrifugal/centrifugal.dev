## Pricing

Centrifugo PRO requires a license key to run. The pricing information for the license key is available upon request over `sales@centrifugal.dev` e-mail. Our services are exclusively available to corporate and business clients at this time. We would be happy to learn more about your real-time challenges and how Centrifugo can help you address them. Don't hesitate to ask for an online meeting to discuss the use case in-person.

## Try for free in sandbox mode

You can try out Centrifugo PRO for free. When you start Centrifugo PRO without license key then it's running in a sandbox mode. Sandbox mode limits the usage of Centrifigo PRO in several ways. For example:

* Centrifugo handles up to 20 concurrent connections
* up to 2 server nodes supported
* up to 5 API requests per second allowed

This mode should be enough for development and trying out PRO features, but must not be used in production environment as we can introduce additional limitations in the future.
