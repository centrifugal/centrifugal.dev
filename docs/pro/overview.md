## Try for free in sandbox mode

You can try out Centrifugo PRO for free. When you start Centrifugo PRO without license key then it's running in a sandbox mode. Sandbox mode limits the usage of Centrifigo PRO in several ways. For example:

* Centrifugo handles up to 20 concurrent connections
* up to 2 server nodes supported
* up to 5 API requests per second allowed

This mode should be enough for development and trying out PRO features, but must not be used in production environment.
